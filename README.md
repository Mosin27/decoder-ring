Caesar cipher: Uses a substitution method where letters in the alphabet are shifted by some fixed number of spaces to yield an encoding alphabet.

Polybius square: Uses a 5x5 grid filled with letters for encryption. A password can be used to generate a deranged alphabet that fills the grid. As latin alphabet has 26 letters and the grid has 25 cells, so in this case I and J are combined into one cell.

Substitution cipher: Substitution cipher is a method of encrypting in which units of plaintext are replaced with the ciphertext, in a defined manner, with the help of a key; the "units" may be single letters, pairs of letters, triplets of letters, mixtures of the above, and so forth.
